in Illinois the sum equaled about $20,000,000 .\",\"Wisconsin and New York have public service commissions .\",\"The American people are indebted to New York State for having been the first one to create a public body of this character .\",\"In 1906 , New York established two public service commissions , one with jurisdiction over the city of Greater New York and the other with authority over the remainder of the State .\",\"In 1906 , New York established two public service commissions , one with jurisdiction over the city of Greater New York and the other with authority over the remainder of the State .\",\"It was fortunate for Greater New York that this public service commission was created shortly before the company controlling the surface street railways of the city went into bankruptcy as the result of its previous reckless financiering .\",\"The interests of the public are being safeguarded , and the transportation facilities of this greatest center of population in America will be better in the future ; because there has been a commisson with powers sufficient to enable it to assist in reconstituting the street railway system of New York .\",\"The substitution of the electric for the steam locomotive within the limits of large cities has been begun on an extensive scale in New York , and in course of time will he carried out in all the other great cities .\",\"The first organized service for the transportation of passengers in cities was supplied by omnibus lines , which began to run in New York City in 1830 , and in Philadelphia the following year .\",\"About twenty years later the street railway and horse cars made their appearance in New York .\",\"New York City took the lead in the use of elevated railways .\",\"The long distance from the lower end of Manhattan Island to the residential portions of New York , and the congested condition of its streets made it absolutely necessary to provide rapid transit by elevated roads .\",\"The first franchise for an elevated street railway in New York // was granted in 1867 , other lines followed in quick succession , and by 1879 New York City 's system of elevated roads was nearly completed .\",\"The first franchise for an elevated street railway in New York // was granted in 1867 , other lines followed in quick succession , and by 1879 New York City 's system of elevated roads was nearly completed .\",\"New York , Washington , and some other cities have wisely refused to permit overhead trolleys in their streets .\",\"In New York there were at the beginning of 1908 , 603 line miles of surface electric roads , 67 line miles of elevated roads , and 22 miles of subways .\",\"The passengers carried on these roads of New York were 1,330,776,165 .\",\"While the surface lines will always have the largest mileage , and in most cities the greater volume of traffic , New York and Chicago have long been obliged to make extensive use of elevated roads ; and , during recent years , such roads have been constructed in Boston and Philadelphia .\",\"The pronounced success of the subways that have been opened in New York , Boston and Philadelphia , and the even greater success of subways in foreign cities , make it certain that // wherever the traffic is heavy enough to warrant the investment , the tendency will be to construct subways to provide rapid transit over the longer routes within crowded cities .\",\"In Philadelphia , for instance , all the street railways are owned by the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company ; in Boston , the Boston Elevated controls all the lines ; and in New York the **25;255;TOOLONG Company has absorbed all the lines .\",\"The State of New York is making amends for the past neglect of its duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commission for Greater New York and another for the rest of the State were established and these two railway commissions were given much larger powers than their predecessor had .\",\"The State of New York is making amends for the past neglect of its duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commission for Greater New York and another for the rest of the State were established and these two railway commissions were given much larger powers than their predecessor had .\",\"It will take some time for public regulation to correct the mistakes that have been committed in the past in Greater New York and the other cities of the State , but the prospects for the future are at least encouraging .\",\"Under the influence of Massachusetts , New York and other progressive commonwealths , progress is being made with the solution of the problem of public regulation of street railways ; and it seems reasonable to expect that it will become customary in the not distant future for all States to require publicity of accounts of all public-service corporations , to subject their capitalization and financial operations to public regulation and to control their charges and services so as fully to safeguard the interests of the cities and the welfare of the public .\",\"The construction of interurban lines has been going on in most parts of the United States but their progress has been exceptionally rapid in New England , New York , in the Central West , and in southern California .\",\"For a number of years , it has been the policy of the New York , New Haven &; Hartford Railroad Company to absorb the electric lines with which it has competition , and also to build electric roads as feeders to its main line .\",\"Electric locomotives will be used in the Pennsylvania Railroad tunnels into and under New York City .\",\"The equipment of the New York terminals of the New York Central and the New York , New Haven &; Hartford railroads , the electrification of the lines of the Long Island Railroad in the western part of Long Island , and the use of electric locomotives in the Pennsyl-Figure // vania Railroad tunnels promise to eliminate the steam locomotive not only from the- central part of New York , but also from the railway lines for some distance out of that city .\",\"The equipment of the New York terminals of the New York Central and the New York , New Haven &;
